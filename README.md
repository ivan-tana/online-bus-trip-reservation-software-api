**API Routes (considerations):**

- Use PUT/PATCH for updating resources appropriately.
- Add routes for filtering and searching trips.
- Implement versioning for future API changes.

**Security:**

- Encrypt user passwords.
- Implement JWT tokens with expiry and refresh mechanisms.
- Authorize access based on user roles and permissions.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Optimize database queries and performance.
-- Document API using OpenAPI Specification.
- Utilize caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- Plan for scalability and redundancy.
